(* Simple expressions: syntax and semantics *)

(* Opening a library for generic programming (https://github.com/dboulytchev/GT).
   The library provides "@type ..." syntax extension and plugins like show, etc.

@type expr =

    ==, !=, <=, <, >=, > --- comparisons
    +, -                 --- addition, subtraction
    *, /, %              --- multiplication, division, reminder

   to value v and returns the new state.

     val eval : state -> expr -> int
